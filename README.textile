I. Discourse on things to come (in the spirit of scheming)
  1. How do I make an object?
    *=>* {}
  2. What does *=>* {} mean?
    Well, *=>* in this context (the context of the README, don't get carried away!) means that the following is a string interpolatable by Hubris.
  3. Is the following code?
    {}
    No! But this is:
    *=>* {}
  4. Are we getting comfortable with the semantics of this discussion?
    I think so!
  5. So can the {} object do anything?
    Nope, but lets make it!
    *=>* { be_nice := "Hello!" }
  6. Well, what can { be_nice := "Hello!" } do?
    *=>* { be_nice := "Hello!" } be_nice
      *<=* "Hello!"
  7. Wait, there's *=>* and *<=* â€½
    Let's say *<=* is the response
